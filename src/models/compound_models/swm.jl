#BM: Most importantly: This needs to be tested on simple numerical examples.
#Test 1: set up a tree with a single partition, run felsenstein for N different models, and manually compute what the mixture likelihood should be. Compare to SWMModel LL.
#Test 2: Check that the LLs, weighting, etc, at all nodes are equal after the down pass (eg. when computing node marginals).

#Slight annoyance with the current setup: The Partition needs to know the weights, because site_LLs() needs to know its weights, and that doesn't see the model.
#But if we change the weights, we kinda want them changed everywhere, which we'd need to do manually.
#Solution for now: have the model and the partition both store the weights, and backward! and forward! will update the Partition from the model.
#This doesn't work, because the total LL is called on the root partition, and forward! and backward! don't touch this.
#Should they change source.weights as well? Ok, lets try that. This requires forcing a prop for the root partition, which is a bit annoying.

#Another way of thinking about this is along the same lines as the root freqs. Leave them out of the model, and force you to set them manually at the root partitions.
#Need to think about how this will interact with the blopt, NNI, ancestors, etc. Those nodes don't know their weights, but do they get that info from the down pass?
#Maybe the weights from above just tweak the site scalings, and then these get used in all site_LL calcs to decide the weight of contribution from each partition
#for each site?

#We'll need to handle the SWM-wide scalings during fwd,bck,combine etc, but that should be easy?
#Unclear is this would give speedups, but I think it would reduce bugs. Might also reduce allocs?
#We could also just set the sub-partitions to be equal to the max over all of them, and not need to store SWM-wide scalings?
