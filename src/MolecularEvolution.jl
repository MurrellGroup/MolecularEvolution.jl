module MolecularEvolution
#This is rougly divided up into five parts:
#1. "core": which contains the tree code, the message passing algorithms, and the tree topology/branch length optimization code
#2. "models": containing type defs for types of states, and models that act on them
#3. "optimization": containing code for parameter optimization - underdeveloped
#4. "bayes": containing code for bayesian inference - underdeveloped
#5. "plots": containing code for drawing trees

#BM ToDo list:
#1. Flesh out the family of ancestral state algorithms, including:
#   a. Marginal ancestral state reconstruction
#   b. "Maximum joint probability" ancestral state reconstruction - requires "max" of partition.
#   - Is there a version of this that maintains multiple options whenever alternative states have non-negligible probability?
#   - In cases where a parent is ambiguous, but a child isn't, we don't want to duplicate the entire tree, so can we collapse back down?
#   - How would we represent this data structure. It seems like a DAG over trees, or something?
#   c. Sample ancestral states conditioned on the endpoint - requires "sample" of partition.
#These should all have consistent behavior in terms of what gets returned
